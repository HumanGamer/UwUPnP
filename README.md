# UwUPnP
This is simple UPnP cross-platform library for the .NET platform.

This was originally based on [UPnPLib](https://github.com/HumanGamer/UPnPLib) which was a C# port of [WaifUPnP](https://github.com/adolfintel/WaifUPnP) for Java.
At this point however, basically all the orginal code was rewritten from scratch. Even most of the core stuff has been completely replaced to make it safer to use and cleaner for the C# standards.

My main reference was (WANIPConnection:1 Service Template Version 1.01)[http://upnp.org/specs/gw/UPnP-gw-WANIPConnection-v1-Service.pdf], the standardization ndocuments of UPnP.

tPnP is a set of wrappers that are intended for use in tML.
